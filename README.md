## Description
A user-centred application to present Columbia Dining options. It improves on the issues with the website regarding speed, inaccuracy of menu options displayed, and inefficiency. It not only presents the dining meal times and menu options, but also includes features such as closing reminders, food ratings by students, crowd monitoring, and live user submissions to update menu inaccuracies. The addition of the live user submissions accounts for the last minute changes of the food options; this was discovered after consulting with the dining administrators. 
## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React-native. 
- Backend: Flask, Python script for webscraping, Cache Density API (results every 15 minutes), PostgreSQL DB, Deployed on Heroku.
